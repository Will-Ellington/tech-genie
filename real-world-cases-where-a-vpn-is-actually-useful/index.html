Below are some real world use cases where a VPN has helped prevent a serious problem.</p><ol class="list-outside list-decimal marker:font-mono marker:text-sm pl-11"><li><span><strong>Protecting against cybercrime</strong>: A user was the victim of a cybercrime and had their personal information stolen. They started using a VPN to encrypt their internet traffic and protect their data from future attacks. The VPN also helped them access their bank account and other sensitive information securely.<br><br></span></li><li><span><strong>Working remotely</strong>: A user was working remotely and needed to access their company's network and files. By using a VPN, they were able to securely connect to their company's network and access the files they needed without compromising the security of the company's data.Â <br><br></span></li><li><span><strong>Avoiding online price discrimination</strong>: A user noticed that they were being charged more for flights and hotel bookings when they searched from their home country. By using a VPN to connect to a server in a different country, they were able to avoid online price discrimination and save money on their bookings.<br><br></span></li><li><span><span><strong>Accessing online gaming servers</strong></span><span>: A user was unable to connect to online gaming servers due to geographical restrictions. By using a VPN to connect to a server in a different location, they were able to bypass the restrictions and connect to the gaming servers they needed.<br><br></span></span></li><li><span><span><strong>Protecting against workplace surveillance</strong></span><span>: A user was concerned that their employer was monitoring their internet activity while working remotely. By using a VPN, they were able to encrypt their internet traffic and prevent their employer from tracking their online activity.<br><br></span></span></li><li><span><span><strong>Protecting against cyberstalking</strong></span><span>: A user was being cyberstalked and wanted to protect their online activity from the stalker. By using a VPN, they were able to mask their IP address and prevent the stalker from tracking their online activity.</span></span></li></ol></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__left"><div class="footer__copy">Powered by Publii</div></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://will-ellington.github.io/tech-genie/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = { mobileMenuMode: 'sidebar', animationSpeed: 300, submenuWidth: 'auto', doubleClickTime: 500, mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus: true, relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector: '.navbar', };</script><script defer="defer" src="https://will-ellington.github.io/tech-genie/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=6450cfc483efd7e58ed8ad5b64050d3e"></script><script>function publiiDetectLoadedImages () {
