                <p>VPNs are not a panacea for web security, but the internet world is defintiely divided between those who do and don't have a VPN. Below are some real world use cases where a VPN has helped prevent a serious problem.</p>
<ol class="list-outside list-decimal marker:font-mono marker:text-sm pl-11">
<li><span class=""><strong>Protecting against cybercrime</strong>: A user was the victim of a cybercrime and had their personal information stolen. They started using a VPN to encrypt their internet traffic and protect their data from future attacks. The VPN also helped them access their bank account and other sensitive information securely.<br><br></span></li>
<li><span class=""><strong>Working remotely</strong>: A user was working remotely and needed to access their company's network and files. By using a VPN, they were able to securely connect to their company's network and access the files they needed without compromising the security of the company's data.Â <br><br></span></li>
<li><span class=""><strong>Avoiding online price discrimination</strong>: A user noticed that they were being charged more for flights and hotel bookings when they searched from their home country. By using a VPN to connect to a server in a different country, they were able to avoid online price discrimination and save money on their bookings.<br><br></span></li>
<li><span class=""><span class=""><strong>Accessing online gaming servers</strong></span><span class="">: A user was unable to connect to online gaming servers due to geographical restrictions. By using a VPN to connect to a server in a different location, they were able to bypass the restrictions and connect to the gaming servers they needed.<br><br></span></span></li>
<li><span class=""><span class=""><strong>Protecting against workplace surveillance</strong></span><span class="">: A user was concerned that their employer was monitoring their internet activity while working remotely. By using a VPN, they were able to encrypt their internet traffic and prevent their employer from tracking their online activity.<br><br></span></span></li>
<li><span class=""><span class=""><strong>Protecting against cyberstalking</strong></span><span class="">: A user was being cyberstalked and wanted to protect their online activity from the stalker. By using a VPN, they were able to mask their IP address and prevent the stalker from tracking their online activity.</span></span></li>
